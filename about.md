I am starting this blog for sharing my technical notes mostly about VueJS, Typescript and similar frameworks.

  Also I have keen interest to share my understanding of competitive coding and like to explain how to approach or solve them based on the problem statement.

  Additionally, I have my spare blog to write about non technical notes and take aways about my life. Most of them consist of my personal opinions, trip regards and books too!
  If you like to check out that, please visit [my-blog-here](<https://azaawriting.blogspot.com/>), I do update regularly.
